Configuration files and custom footprints for creating PCBs using [ergogen](https://github.com/ergogen/ergogen).

My custom footprints have many uncommented modifications, so I don't recommend using them separately. Eventually, I plan to organize these properly in a separate repository.

Anyway! Please check out the amazing tool called ergogen and try it for yourself.
